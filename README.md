# Solitaire (Developing)
Solitaire is a faster Linearizability checker supporting multi-interface.

Given a concurrent history, Solitaire will determine whether the history is Linearizability by finding a sequential specification. The basic algorithm is described in [Faster linearizability checking via P-compositionality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.00204.pdf).
    
Solitaire is named after the famous Windows card game, which involve dealing cards from a shuffled deck into a prescribed arrangement on a tabletop.
